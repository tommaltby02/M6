Diffusion Coefficients
A:
A is almsot a perfect straight line demonstrating simple diffusion with a diffusion
coefficient of 0.00233 σ^2 tau^-1.

B:
B demonstrates subdiffusion, there is an initial simple diffusion followed by a plateau indicating the mean squared displacement is not directly proportional to time. Instead <r^2> ~ t^a where a < 1. The diffusion coefficient for the intial simple diffusion scheme is 4.6753E-06 σ^2 tau^-1.

A has a much large diffusion coefficient than B and therefore diffuses much faster. A is a gas species and B is likely a solid due to the small diffusion coefficient and non linear diffusion.

Diffusion coefficients were calculated using D = d<r^2>/dt * 1/2.

To improve sampling one could sample every n frames to better visualise the diffusion curve.
